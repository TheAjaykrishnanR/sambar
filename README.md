> A native status bar for Windows 11 written in C# (.NET) with love ❤️. Utilizes the WPF technology and native interop to 
provide a rich set of functionalities which can be consumed through widgets. You can write your own widgets utilizing
the api functions and events provided from the app to spare yourself from reinventing the wheel. Or you can even leverage
the C# standard library and build features from scratch. **Everything** is configurable: The layout, dimensions,
positions and colors are <ins>fully customizable</ins>. [dive in?](https://www.google.com)
