# Configuration

Code and configuration are the same. Everything configurable in Sambar are present in `.cs` files in the `WidgetPacks` folder. There are no `json` or `yaml` files. At its core sambar exposes an api and is a script runner. With this approach it is possible to customize sambar to its fullest extend. You are not limited to the customization thats exposed by a widget, instead you can customize the widget yourself.
