# Welcome to sambar docs !

The docs cover everything you need to successfully run, configure and develop plugins for the sambar status bar.
Have a quick rundown through basics to get started with setting up sambar, how to launch the app, read the logs etc.
For more indepth topics such as configuring the widgets or even creating new ones, go through the tutorial. While developing
new plugins the Sambar Api is incredibly useful, see the Api reference here.
